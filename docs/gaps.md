# Gaps and TODOs

Each line names what is guessed or missing, where it is in the code, and the source doc
(`~/IdeaProjects/mmx-demake-tools/docs/`). Code `TODO` comments point here.

## From the spec

- Shot sprites: `x-shots/` has no `animations.json`, and there is no export of the Falcon full
  charge (shot 19). Shot 19 uses the plain full charge (id 18) art and box. (`docs/players/attacks.md`)
- Sabre hit box: the docs give only "box from the frame flag". The box is a guess.
  (`docs/players/weapons.md`, "The other ids that X makes")
- D-1000 sprites: no combined export; animations 0–5 come from `d-1000`, 6–23 from `d-1000-parts`.
  (`docs/enemies/d-1000.md`, "Sprites")

## Skipped on purpose

- Item drops (health, weapon energy, extra lives): the drop weights exist, the drops are out of
  scope. (`docs/engine.md`, "Death, debris and drops")
